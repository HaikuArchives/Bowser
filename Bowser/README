What's New in d39?

Lots! For quick reference, a number of bugs have been fixed and several frequently requested features have been added, including /IGNORE, /EXCLUDE, /UNIGNORE  and /LIST.

/IGNORE can be performed on a nick (for instance, /ignore l33t_guy - this is case insensitive) or on an address 
(/ignore .*@.*aol\.com). Ignoring by address makes use of regular expressions, so if you're unfamiliar or uncomfortable with them, stick to ignoring by nick.

/UNIGNORE is much the same. /unignore l33t_guy or /unignore  .*@.*aol\.com, to stick with the examples used above. If you originally used /ignore on someone and specified their nick, you must /unignore them by nick as well. Same applies to /unignoring an address.

/EXCLUDE is a special case. If you have /IGNOREd all of AOL, as in the above example, you may realize that someone you want to talk with is for whatever reason connecting via AOL. You can use /EXCLUDE to allow that person, and that person only, to talk to you despite the AOL ignore. For example: /exclude .*@.*aol\.com l33t_dude

/LIST calls up a list of channels on the current server. Once the list has been completed, it can be sorted by channel name or number of users, and can also be filtered. Filtering the list is accomplished through regular expressions once again. Entering #beos* in the filter requestor will display all channels with names starting with #beos in them, as a simple example.

Introduction -- What is Bowser?

Bowser is an IRC client for the BeOS. Some of Bowser's main features are: a clean interface, compatability with a large subset of IRC commands, relative stability, incoming and outgoing CTCP, and DCC send and receive. Please note that Bowser is still BETA software -- that's why it's not on BeWare yet! It is slowly improving and should be ready for a public release sometime in the near future -- but it's quite possible that the release date can vary a few weeks/months either direction. If Bowser crashes on you, it would be appreciated if you could send in a stack crawl from the debugger if you know how ("details" on a crash, then "debugger", then type "sc" and hit enter) as this will greatly help in debugging. If you don't know how to do a stack crawl, feel free to send in normal bug reports - the more detailed, the better. Feature requests are welcome too. Thanks for using Bowser!

How do I use Bowser?

Configuring Bowser should be fairly simple. In the original setup dialog, just select a nickname and an alternate nickname. If you don't know what to put in the rest of the boxes, just leave them as they are -- the default values should work adequately. Once in Bowser, the following commands are available:  <> signifies a required parameter, [] signifies an optional parameter.

/CLEAR (clears all text from the current window)
/CTCP <USER> <COMMAND> (send a CTCP request to a user)
/DCC <CHAT/SEND> <USER> (send a file to user or dcc chat with user)
/DEOP <USER> (deop a user in current channel, if you're an op)
/DOP <USER> (deop a user in current channel, if you're an op)
/EXCLUDE <NICK AND ADDRESS> (exempts a user from an ISP-wide /IGNORE on your list)
/IGNORE <NICK OR ADDRESS> (blocks all messages from a user who is specified by nick or by address)
/INVITE <USER> [CHANNEL] (invite user to current channel or specified channel)
/J <CHANNEL> (alias for /JOIN)
/JOIN <CHANNEL> (join a channel)
/K <USER> [REASON] (alias for /KICK)
/KICK <USER> [REASON] (kick a user from current channel, if you're an op)
/LIST (calls up a sortable list of all channels on the current server.)
/M <USER> (alias for /MSG)
/ME <ACTION> (perform an action in a channel)
/MODE <TARGET> [MODE] (request mode info, or set mode on self/channel)
/MOTD (request server message of the day)
/MSG <USER | MESSAGE> (send a private message to a user)
/NAMES <CHANNEL> (request a list of user nicks in the current channel)
/NICK <USER> (change your nickname)
/NOTICE <USER | MESSAGE> (send a notice to a user)
/OP <USER> (op a user in current channel, if you're an op)
/PART (leave current channel)
/PING <USER> (request a ping from a user)
/Q <USER> (open a query (private message) with with user)
/QUERY <USER> (open a query (private message) with with user)
/QUIT [REASON] (quit the network. does NOT close windows)
/RAW <MESSAGE> (send a raw command to server. useful for unimplemented stuff)
/T [TOPIC] (set the channel topic, or view the current topic (with no arg))
/TOPIC [TOPIC] (set the channel topic, or view the current topic (with no arg))
/UNIGNORE <NICK OR ADDRESS> (removes a nick or an address from your ignore list)
/WHOIS <USER> [REPEAT] (request whois information on a user)
/WHOWAS <USER> (same as /whois, but for users who are no longer on IRC)
/W <USER> (alias for /whois)
/WII <USER> (alias for /whois user user, shows idle time)

In addition, simply type in a channel or message window to send messages to the channel or user. /ME can be used as an action only in channel or message windows. If you want to open a message window for chatting with a user, simply double click on their name in the channel nameslist -- otherwise, a message window will popup when they first message you, but not if you first use /MSG to send them a message. In addition, if you right click on a name in the nameslist, a menu will pop up with a number of commonly used commands. Most server responses are shown in the active window, if appropriate. You can type ALT-Q to shut down all windows and quit Bowser immediatly, or ALT-COMMA/ALT-PERIOD to switch between active windows.
