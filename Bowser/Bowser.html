<h2><center>Bowser</center></h2>
<hr>
Bowser is an IRC client for the <a href="http://www.be.com">BeOS</a>
platform.  Its original source was authored by 
<a href="mailto:abazan@berbee.com">Andrew Bazan</a> and can be
found at
<a href="http://www.sitebe.com/abazan/Bowser.html">Andrew's web site</a>.
Because of his busy schedule at college, Andrew has stated
that he no longer can devote as much time to Bowser's
development.  I've tried to help out with this and am 
providing what I've done to Bowser here.  Many improvements
and features have already been added and are detailed below.
Thank you Andrew for all the hours you spent writing Bowser,
and making it very easy to enhance it.
<p>
Andrew opened the source to Bowser, so I will continue to
keep it open.  You can either download an Intel binary or
the complete source.  I do not have access to a Power PC
machine, so no binaries for that platform are available.
You must have <a href="http://www.be.com">BeOS 4.5</a>
to use this release.

<b>If you're installing this version of Bowser as a replacement for Day
36 and lower releases, it's important that
you remove your existing Bowser executable and the
~/config/settings/Bowser_Settings file.</b>  The old
settings format is incompatiable with the current release, but
this should be the last time the settings file needs to be wiped.
For support, email
<a href="mailto:bowser@tvl-p.com">me (Todd Lair)</a>
or Andrew.
<p>
I must thank <a href="mailto:mcleodg@dire-wolf.com">Gord McLeod</a>
for all his great suggestions and testing.  He really has helped
me out a lot, and I have a ways to go before all his ideas are
implemented.

<h3>Day 40</h3>
This release is provided and coded by
<a href="mailto:guru@startrek.com">Wade Majors</a> with a few
extras slipped in.  Thanks Wade!
<ul>
	<li><b>Deskbar Icon</b><br>
		Notification options are now called Deskbar Icon options and
		should be easier to understand now.  The application icon itself
		was reverted back to the old Bowser icon (I guess I'm the
		artist I thought I was).<p>

		Users can now specify under the Deskbar Icon preferences
		other nicks to watch for, and optionally flash those blue.
		They can be specified in the space delimited text
		field, "Other nicks".  In case a user wants to watch for
		that special someone :)  Note: the new precedence order
		for flash is first users nick or aka, other nicks, and
		finally content.  New menu item "Other notification" on the
		client windows enables or disables this on a window basis.<p>

		Additionally, a user can specify the number of seconds for
		an auto nick blue flash with the "Auto nick timeout" field
		in the Deskbar Icon preferences.  If a user does specify a
		a timeout value greater than zero, mentions a nick other
		than his or her own, and the nick mentioned user says something
		within the timeout period, the user with the nick mentioned will
		cause a blue flash when he or she says something.

	<li><b>Setup Window</b><br>
		Option to hide the setup window when you connect to a server
		and an option to activate the setup window when you disconnect
		added.  If the user has connect on startup enabled, user will
		not see the setup window until disconnected.
	<li><b>Server Enums</b><br>
		Server Enums added for new commands.
	<li><b>Aliases</b><br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>/t</b> alias for <b>/topic</b>
			<li><b>/deop</b> alias for <b>/dop</b>
			<li><b>/q</b> alias for <b>/query</b>
			<li><b>/w</b> alias for <b>/whois</b> (instead of <b>/wi</b>)
		</ul>
	<li><b>Version Command</b><br>
		Version command, by itself, sends a version request to the
		server.  With a nick, it sends a ctcp version request to
		the nick.
	<li><b>MOTD Command</b><br>
		MOTD command now sends parameters directly to server.
	<li><b>Operator Commands</b><br>
		The following operator commands were added:
		<ul>
			<li><b>/oper</b>
			<li><b>/rehash</b>
			<li><b>/stats</b>
			<li><b>/admin</b>
			<li><b>/info</b>
			<li><b>/kill</b>
			<li><b>/trace</b>
			<li><b>/wallops</b>
		</ul>
		Also, the /op and /deop commands accept up to four nicks
		instead of just the previous one.
	<li><b>Raw Command</b><br>
		The /raw command now echos the string to the main
		text view.
	<li><b>Voice Popup</b><br>
		Voice and devoice entries added to nicklist popup menu
	<li><b>AFK</b><br>
		The /away and /back commands have been added along with
		preferences in the Command section to allow default
		action text.  If /away is used with a parameter, the parameter
		will be used as the away text, otherwise the preference text
		will be used.
	<li><b>Preferences</b><br>
		Preferences are now accessable from any client window with
		the window/preference menu item or with Alt-P.
	<li><b>Local Channels</b><br>
		Added support for local channels.  Joining &amplocal doesn't
		try to join #&amplocal.
	<li><b>Tab Completion</b><br>
		Tab completion will now first try to match the channel name,
		and then if unsuccessful, the nick list.
	<li><b>Zooming</b><br>
		Client windows are now zoomable.
	<li><b>Droppings</b><br>
		Users can now drop non text files on a message window
		input control, and Bowser will kick off a dcc send to
		the targeted irc user the message window is for.
	<li><b>Status Bars</b><br>
		Added server and current nick to the status bar for
		message and server windows.
	<li><b>Double Ops</b><br>
		Fixed bug when users were deoped or oped twice.  Op count
		in status bar would get incremented twice.
	<li><b>Server Windows</b><br>
		Added navigation to next and previous server windows with
		the Window menu items "Next Server" and "Previous Server".
	<li><b>Timestamp</b><br>
		If user has timestamp preference turned on, more things
		will be timestamped.
	<li><b>Notify</b><br>
		Added /notify and /unnotify commands.  Users can use these
		commands to add to the list of nicks to watch.  Watched
		nicks will be displayed in the notify window as dark gray
		if they are not connected to the irc server and black if
		they are.  Messages will be displayed and posted to active
		window when a nick has changed connection status, and event
		preferences have been added to control what is displayed.
</ul>

<h3>Day 39b</h3>
This release is provided and coded by
<a href="mailto:jamie@tave.com">Jamie Wilkinson</a>.  Thanks Jamie!
<ul>
	<li><b>Icon</b><br>
		Icon changed along with deskbar flashing.  Yellow means content,
		and red still means nick.
	<li><b>Connect at Launch</b><br>
		In server's options window, added preference to start up
		server upon application's launch.  Note: with this and code
		added, multiple and simultaneous connections work.
	<li><b>Auto Input Focus</b><br>
		Added code, so if main text view is current focus and user types
		a key, the keypress will be forwarded to input control and the
		input control will be made current focus.
	<li><b>Crashing</b><br>
		Crashing bug fixed when user switches current server to one that
		had the option window open.
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Day 39a</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Menus</b><br>
	Added Window menu and moved navigation items to it.  Also
	added a means to get to the Server and Setup windows.
	<li><b>Scrolling</b><br>
	Added ability to turn off scrolling in the main window.  Scrolling
	is now automatically turned off if a user slides the scrollbar tab
	up.  If scrolling isn't toggled off and the user returns the scrollbar
	tab to the bottom, scrolling will continue.
	<li><b>List Joins</b><br>
	Users can now join channels from the List window by simply invoking
	the list item.
	<li><b>Server Copy</b><br>
	Added ability to copy current server from the server menu field.
	This will copy all states of the current server into the new one
	including ignores, options, and nick orders.
	<li><b>Initial Messages</b><br>
	If a user has preference open message window with sends, the
	initial message was not being placed in history.  Fixed.
	<li><b>Server Options</b><br>
	Sizing problems with Server Options window corrected.
	<li><b>DCC Send</b><br>
	<ul>
		<li>DCC send works from the command line.
		<li>Bowser had a problem with sending files a little larger than
			most due to the fact that the sender was not reading the
			confirmation data from the socket (it would fill up).  Fixed.
		<li>Changes to status bar labels now report bytes per second on
			both sending and receiving windows.
		<li>DCC file transfer windows will now close when completed.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Window Anchoring</b><br>
	Added in preferences the ability to toggle anchoring of windows
	with General's "Window selection follows workspace"
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Day 39</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Server Nickname</b><br>
	The server was not updating its copy of the current nickname,
	so this caused problems when trying to join new channels
	after you change your nick.  Fixed.
	<li><b>Tab Completion</b><br>
	Tab completion now replaces what the user has typed with
	the actual nick instead of postfixing the remaining.  This
	fixes case differences between what the user has typed
	and the actual nick.
	<li><b>Server Options</b><br>
	New server options window provided.  User can gain access
	through the server name menu field, and allows extra settings
	for a particular server.  Current options are as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Ability to ignore initial motd
		<li>Ability to enable identd for server.  Some servers 
		 	do not connect to the machine Bowser is running on 
			for an identd server.  For these servers, Bowser 
			appears to just sit there and do nothing if the 
			user had the identd server enabled.  Moving it 
			to the server level allows users to connect to 
			ones that attempt to connect to the local machine 
			for identification as well as ones that don't.  
			For the one's that don't, simply disable the 
			the identd for that server.
		<li>Ability to enter commands that will be issued upon connect.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Ignore System</b><br>
	Ability to ignore other users has been added.  A user can either
	ignore on a nickname or an address.  Addresses are specified as
	regular expressions, are case insensitive, and must contain the
	character '@'.  Nicks are matched exactly (excluding case).
	Nickname ignores will follow nickname changes, and both
	nickname and address ignores save.<br>
	Address ignores often cannot be realized immediately.  They will
	take effect when other users say something, and the user will
	be notified that they are ignoring them.<br>
	Color preferences and command preferences also have been added for
	ignores.  Users who are being ignored appear in the bottom
	of the names list.  Command preferences add <b>$i</b> as a
	variable to view which ignore was applied.<br>
	The following commands have been added for the ignore system:
	<ul>
		<li><b>/IGNORE &ltnick | address&gt</b> Adds an ignore.
		<li><b>/UNIGNORE &ltnick | address&gt</b> Removes an ignore.
		<li><b>/EXCLUDE &ltaddress nick&gt</b> Excludes nick from
			address ignore.
	</ul>
	As well, a GUI has been added for the ignore system and can be
	accessed with Alt-I from any client window.  The ignore window
	will allow additions, removals, and exclusions of ignores.  Care
	has been taken, so commands will update GUI's content if left open.<br>
	When unignoring, a user must specify the exact ignore he or she added.
	That is, if a user adds an ignore by address, they cannot remove it
	with a nick.
	<li><b>Nickname Save</b><br>
	A bug relating to initial nickname saves has been fixed.
	<li><b>Input Font Preference</b><br>
	Users can now set which font is used for the input control.
	<li><b>Channel PING's</b><br>
	When user issues command /ctcp #channel PING, correct ping
	times are now reported.
	<li><b>Channel Name's</b><br>
	When a user joins a channel, Bowser was not adding the names
	from additional user reports.  Fixed.
	<li><b>List Command</b><br>
	Added ability to query current channels with the <b>/LIST</b>
	command.  When executing the list command, users are shown
	a window and given status on channel load.  Once load is
	complete, users have the ability to find and filter results
	with regular expressions.  Two sort orders are provide
	as well: channel and user count.
	<li><b>Additional Bugs</b><br>
	More bugs were fixed with this release, however I forgot
	to jot down what they were.  Some where very quick and while
	I was chatting with a few people on IRC.  If after trying
	this release you still have a bug issue, please email me;
	I've either thought it fixed or lost the post it.
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Day 38b</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>DCC Chat</b><br>
	Problems with Deskbar crashing when using DCC chat fixed.  Also,
	nickname changes work in DCC chat windows.  Another problem
	with chatting was that the initiator was sending the LAN IP
	address instead of the DUN supplied one if the user had a
	LAN setup.  This is now fixed as well; I simply now use
	the address you connected from and to the IRC Server.<br>
	This should make DCC chat very usuable.  It's far from
	perfect and deserves a little more work though.
	<li><b>Input Control Drop</b><br>
	Request when dropping a single line to input control now
	places text in the control instead of sending it off
	directly to the connection has been implemented.
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Day 38a</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>DCC Chat</b><br>
	This was on my list of "get to's" before release, and well...
	I didn't get to it.  Here is a working DCC chat build.
	Sorry about that folks.
	<li><b>Tab Completion</b><br>
	No longer case sensitive
	<li><b>Notification Enable</b><br>
	When enabling notification from None to another state and
	having open channel/server/message windows, the windows
	will register themselves with the deskbar icon.  The deskbar
	was crashing otherwise.
	<li><b>DCC File Receive</b><br>
	When receiving a file from someone else on IRC, Bowser will
	now prompt the user for a place to store the file and a name.
	<li><b>Command Preference</b><br>
	New preferences added to configure default quit and kick
	messages.  The following supported variable is available
	for quits.
		<ul>
			<li><b>$V</b> Current Bowser Day Count
		</ul>
	<li><b>Ident Server Preference</b><br>
	Added (General) preference to turn off the built in ident server.
	<li><b>Font Preferences</b><br>
	Moved allocation of controls for Font preferences from
	the constructor of the Font preference view to the
	AttachedToWindow hook; Gord has 3000 fonts, and this speeds
	it up for him if he doesn't have to change his fonts.
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Day 38</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Preference Organization</b><br>
		Restructered preferences dialog for dynamic views.  Allows
		easy additions.
	<li><b>History Control</b><br>
		Added a control that provides easy access to the history
	 	of commands entered.  Added a History menuitem, so keypressers
		have access.
	<li><b>Color Preferences</b><br>
		Expanded color preferences from one ColorLabel to one
		ColorLabel for each color preference
	<li><b>Event Text</b><br>
		Added the ability to configure event text displayed.
		and preference view Event.  For each event text,
		all available variables are used for the event by default;
		all events do not use all variables.  Variables have the
		following meaning:
		<ul>
			<li><b>$N</b> Nickname
			<li><b>$n</b> Alternate Nickname
			<li><b>$I</b> Ident
			<li><b>$A</b> Address
			<li><b>$R</b> Remaining Text In Line
			<li><b>$C</b> Channel
			<li><b>$T</b> Topic
		</ul>

	<li><b>Status Bar</b><br>
		Status bar is now a little more pleasing to look at.
		Displays server, user count, op count, modes, and user's
		current nickname for channel windows.
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 37</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Speed Improvements</b><br>
		Network code completely rewritten to provide huge
		speed improvements.  Used the new Network kit more
		to see if I liked it; I don't think I do.<br>
		Other improvements to speed are riddled through out the
		new code, and I think most will find that Bowser is pretty
		snappy.
	<li><b>Clean Up</b><br>
		Major rewrite of a lot of the code and restructuring
		the class layout of the different types of windows.
		Code is much cleaner.
	<li><b>Memory Leaks</b><br>
		Squashed all those nasty memory leaks Bowser was very
		fond of.  I dare you to find one!
	<li><b>Lazy Resize</b><br>
		Bowser's lazy resize of controls within a window now
		fixed.  Still flickers, but snappier.
	<li><b>Lazy Quit And Part</b><br>
		Bowser now closes the windows with the quit and part
		commands.  Quit terminates the server connection, while
		part closes the channel or message window only.
	<li><b>Colored Selection</b><br>
		When selecting text in the main view, Bowser would
		lose all of its color highlighting.  Fixed.
	<li><b>Font Preferences</b><br>
		Added configuration of Server, Text, URL, and Name fonts.
		Font preferences do not change existing text in the
		channel, message, and server windows, but it will change
		new text added. (I'm working on this)
	<li><b>Color Preferences</b><br>
		Added configuration for most if not all colors for Bowser.
		I may have missed a few--if so, let me know.  Like font
		preferences, color preferences are not imposed on existing
		text in the server, channel and message windows.  They will
		eventually.
	<li><b>Notification</b><br>
		Bowser can now live in the deskbar!  For inactive windows,
		the icon will flash green when there is new content and red
		if someone mentions the user's nickname.  Clicking on the
		icon will display  a pop up menu to show what windows are
		the cause of the flash.  Shift-click on the icon will make
		the window with new content active regardless of hidden
		state.  The newly activated window will be displayed
		in the current workspace.  Nickname flash takes precedence,
		so the icon will never flash green when red, and shift clicking
		will display the nickname mentioned window over the new
		content window.<br>
		Users have the ability to turn off notification on nickname
		or content level as well as the flash.  They can also turn
		off notification for a particular window, and it will save
		with the window's settings.  Users also have the ability
		to add names to enable the nickname flash with the "Also
		Known As" preference.  These space delimited names will
		be treated the same as the user's nickname for purposes
		of notification and nickname highlight.
	<li><b>Nickname Highlight</b><br>
		User's nickname now correctly highlights.
	<li><b>URL Highlight</b><br>
		Bug's fixed in URL highlight now squashed.  Lines containing
		multiple urls were not being displayed and highlighted
		correctly--they are now.
	<li><b>Multiple Servers</b><br>
		Bowser now supports multiple servers.  Enough said.
	<li><b>Central Nicknames</b><br>
		Bowser now stores its nicknames apart from the server
		settings and supports multiple nicknames.  For the
		server settings, only the order of the nicknames are
		saved, so a user can specify which order the nicknames
		are tried for each server.  Preferences (in General)
		supports nicknames bound to a server.  This gives the
		illusion that nicknames are stored on the server side,
		but still remain in a central repository.<br>
		The nickname listbox can be right clicked to show a pop
		up menu in which the user can add or remove a nickname.
		If the nicknames are bound to servers, the menu also
		contains a load item which will add all nicknames to
		that particular server.  The order of the nicknames
		can be changed by shift Up/Down arrow while a nickname
		is selected.
	<li><b>Drag and Drop</b><br>
		I'm probably going to get banned from IRC for this, but
		a user can now drag and drop either text or plain text files
		to the input control.  It supports commands and or normal
		messages.  It is great for posting code though.
	<li><b>Command Line</b><br>
		The following command line arguments were added:
		<ul>
			<li><b>-r</b>
				dumps received data on stdout
			<li><b>-s</b>
				dumps sent data on stdout
			<li><b>-v</b>
				displays embeded and unsupported codes in hex
			<li><b>-i</b>
				shows the id of the window with every channel
				message
			<li><b>-n</b>
				displays debug code for nickname removal
			<li><b>-N</b>
				shows status of adding a deskbar icon
			<li><b>-u</b>
				disables attempt to odopt orphoned deskbar icon
		</ul>
	<li><b>Tab Completion</b><br>
		Nicknames will be completed with press of the tab
		key in the input control.  I simply added code to
		look for the first match.
</ul>
